# About api

_This APi will allow the user the possibility of obtaining data through the use of POSTMAN application which allows us to request requests and in this way based on the URL that we indicate, we will be able to obtain different types of data such as obtaining of a JSON with data on songs or on users, the possibility of adding, modifying or deleting a song which we indicate in this same URL._
